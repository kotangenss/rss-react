This project is a modern web application built using React and TypeScript, with a development environment powered by Vite. It utilizes various tools and libraries for testing, linting, and code formatting to ensure code quality and maintainability ([SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)).

**Enjoy!**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

This script starts the development of your project using Vite, which is a modern web development environment. Your project will be available at the specified address, typically `http://localhost:3000`.

### `npm run build`

This script compiles TypeScript code (`tsc`) and then builds the project using Vite.

### `npm run lint`

This script runs ESLint to analyze your TypeScript and TypeScript JSX code. It checks your code for compliance with the standards and rules specified in your ESLint configuration file. If there are errors or warnings, the script will display them.

### `npm run format:fix`

This script automatically formats your code using Prettier to match the coding style and conventions. If Prettier makes any code changes, the script will display a success message, otherwise, it will indicate formatting errors.

### `npm run prepare`

This script installs Husky, which is a tool for configuring Git hooks. This can be useful for automating tasks before commits, such as running a linter.

### `npm run test`

This script runs tests for your application using Vitest, likely a testing framework for Vue.js. It also generates a code coverage report, showing which parts of your code have been tested.
